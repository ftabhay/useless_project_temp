# Useful Background Wallpaper üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Archers


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Abhay M V - sahrdaya college of engineering and technology
- Member 2: Aaron Thomas - sahrdaya college of engineering and technology
- Member 3: Abellash C Mathew - sahrdaya college of engineering and technology

### Project Description
A Python-based program that logs keystrokes in real-time and updates the desktop wallpaper with the current text input.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Ever felt like your desktop needed to show your exact typing, word by word, as it happens? Probably not. But we‚Äôre solving it anyway!

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
A dynamic program that monitors keystrokes and updates the desktop wallpaper with your current typing. It resets the wallpaper when the input exceeds 534 characters, ensuring your background stays fresh!

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- **Languages used**: Python
- **Frameworks used**: None
- **Libraries used**: `Pillow`, `pynput`, `ctypes`, `pathlib`, `os`
- **Tools used**: Python environment, image editing software for background

For Hardware:
- **List main components**: Standard desktop/laptop with Python installed
- **List specifications**: Windows OS (for `ctypes` use)
- **List tools required**: None (all software-based)

### Implementation
For Software:
# Installation
```bash
pip install Pillow pynput
```

# Run
```bash
python keylogger_desktop_changer.py
```

### Project Documentation
